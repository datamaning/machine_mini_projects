the message  It seems to me that the terms of the PB\n   conflict\n   because J14 conflicts with A3 that is i  J14 conflicts with Par8\n   requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply

conflict\n   with\n   the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to the PB\n   except\n   for silence on the matter  You didnt address this point  It is Enron\n   Corp policy to include

Agreement the Agreement\n      with my colleague Angela Davis\n\n      I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter\n   relating\n      to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed but\n      were not in a position to resolve at the time  These are\n\n      1  Par 8 Arbitration which should conform to Clause J Par 14 of\n      the Agreement  I recall that we were discussing the possible use of\n      arbitration in the Agreement and existence of arbitration in the\n   OSLA\n      so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of the\n      Terms of Business Letter  Since we ultimately agreed to English\n   courts\n      I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will\n      prevail if in conflict with the Agreement\n\n      2  Par 8 Arbitration which should be limited in the same manner\n   as\n      Clause J Par 11 as to limitation of liability  I believe that you\n      and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement  Why shouldnt\n      these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter\n\n      I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the\n      account

 Daniel\n\n         Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement the\n   Agreement\n         with my colleague Angela Davis\n\n         I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business Letter\n      relating\n         to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we discussed\n   but\n         were not in a position to resolve at the time  These are\n\n         1  Par 8 Arbitration which should conform to Clause J Par 14\n   of\n         the Agreement  I recall that we were discussing the possible use\n   of\n         arbitration in the Agreement and existence of arbitration in the\n      OSLA\n         so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph of\n   the\n         Terms of Business Letter  Since we ultimately agreed to English\n      courts\n         I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter which will\n         prevail if in conflict with the Agreement\n\n         2  Par 8 Arbitration which should be limited in the same\n   manner\n      as\n         Clause J Par 11 as to limitation of liability  I believe that\n   you\n         and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement  Why\n   shouldnt\n         these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter\n\n         I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest of the\n         account documentation  Regards\n\n         Sara Shackleton\n

terms and span your\n         relationship\n            with GSI generally There may be nonprime brokerage issues\n   that\n         relate\n            to\n            the terms of business Not everything in the TOBs intersects\n   with\n      the\n         PB\n            relationship certainly if you do other business with GSI\n\n            Re the liability provision I think your concerns are\n   adequately\n            addressed\n            in the documentation as drafted\n\n            I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as\n      possible\n         so\n

International\n\n\n            Daniel\n\n            Thanks for the message  It seems to me that the terms of the\n   PB\n            conflict\n            because J14 conflicts with A3 that is i  J14 conflicts with\n      Par8\n            requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to\n   the\n         Terms\n            of\n            Business agreement and ii A3 requires that English courts\n      prevail\n            Are\n            you agreeing with this analysis\n\n            Also there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to\n      conflict\n            with\n            the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to\n   the\n      PB\n            except\n            for silence on the matter  You didnt address this point  It\n   is\n         Enron\n            Corp policy to include such language and I would like to limit\n      the\n            Terms\n            of Business in the same manner\n\n            Can you call me at 9 am

I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business\n   Letter\n            relating\n               to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we\n      discussed\n         but\n               were not in a position to resolve at the time  These are\n\n               1  Par 8 Arbitration which should conform to Clause J\n   Par\n      14\n         of\n               the Agreement  I recall that we were discussing the\n   possible\n      use\n         of\n               arbitration in the Agreement and existence of arbitration\n   in\n      the\n            OSLA\n               so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph\n   of\n         the\n               Terms of Business Letter  Since we ultimately agreed to\n      English\n            courts\n               I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter\n   which\n      will\n               prevail if in conflict with the Agreement\n\n               2  Par 8 Arbitration which should be limited in the same\n         manner\n            as\n               Clause J Par 11 as to limitation of liability  I believe\n      that\n         you\n               and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement  Why\n         shouldnt\n               these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter\n\n               I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest\n   of\n      the\n

conflicts with\n      Par8\n            requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to\n   the\n         Terms\n            of\n            Business agreement and ii A3 requires that English courts\n      prevail\n            Are\n            you agreeing with this analysis\n\n            Also there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to\n      conflict\n            with\n            the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to\n   the\n      PB\n            except\n            for silence on the matter  You didnt address this point  It\n   is\n

I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business\n   Letter\n            relating\n               to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we\n      discussed\n         but\n               were not in a position to resolve at the time  These are\n\n               1  Par 8 Arbitration which should conform to Clause J\n   Par\n      14\n         of\n               the Agreement  I recall that we were discussing the\n   possible\n      use\n         of\n               arbitration in the Agreement and existence of arbitration\n   in\n      the\n            OSLA\n               so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph\n   of\n         the\n               Terms of Business Letter  Since we ultimately agreed to\n      English\n            courts\n               I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter\n   which\n      will\n               prevail if in conflict with the Agreement\n\n               2  Par 8 Arbitration which should be limited in the same\n         manner\n            as\n               Clause J Par 11 as to limitation of liability  I believe\n      that\n         you\n               and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement  Why\n         shouldnt\n               these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter\n\n               I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest\n   of\n      the\n

aS' tjonesnsf\r\n\r\nThis provision is an election which we have added to the Schedule for \ngovernmental entities  I believe that it is intended to eliminate any \nconfusion that historically arose during the debate between First Method \noneway payments and Second Method twoway payments for Early \nTermination purposes  Although I cant find a good reason to continue to use \nthis provision with an ISDA except that it emphasizes the point I can \nunderstand why we may have added it to a preISDA agreement with a \ngovernmental  The only example that I could locate was our September 21 \n1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District  For those of \nyou who have never seen this form it was one of the two types of master \nagreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA  Because \nthese forms didnt contemplate municipal counterparties we had to add many \nof the ISDA US Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions  The Part \n5bk provision originally appeared in this early agreement  It was \nincluded in the Event of Change section 5F4 which is tantamount to the \nISDA concept of Illegality a Termination Event  I think it was \nprobably included because in the ISDA Second Method is the automatic payment \nmethod if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early \nTermination purposes but there isnt a comparable provision in the old ECT \nform \n'
